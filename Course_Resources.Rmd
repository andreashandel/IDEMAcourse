This page lists resources that are used or mentioned in this course. For a more extensive list of resources, see the _General Resources_ page.

All materials described below are (should be) freely available online. If you can't get to them, let me know. Note that a lot of the listed resources are dynamic and ever changing. That means occasionally links might not work, sites go offline, chapters in online books get re-arranged, etc. If you notice anything that's not quite right, please let me know.

# General help

* The main place to get any course specific help are the various Slack channels in our class workspace. Use them widely to ask questions, to answer others' questions, to post links to interesting resources, etc. 
* There will very likely be times when some material in the course doesn't quite make sense and you need to do some auxiliary reading. Google will be your best friend. Wikipedia is often a very good starting point for many topics. 



# Books

* [Infectious Disease Epidemiology - a Model-based Approach (IDEMAB)](https://andreashandel.github.io/IDEMAbook/). This is the book that goes with the class, it is basically an extended version of my previous lecture notes. 


# Online courses

Throughout this course, I link to videos from a few online courses that cover a similar topic to this course. While the videos are embedded and you do not need to sign up for those online courses, if you are interested, you could. Signing up for those courses should be free.

* [Epidemics I]() -
* [Epidemics II]() - 

Note that the HKU courses used to be a single course called "Epidemics".



# Hands-on/interactive resources
